    - This also contains sub-directory for PAL, Value (the type rendered by interpretation), and utils (containing our Environment/Store Tuples
    - Standard Prelude is contained within interpreter/utils/EnvStoreTuple.java
3. main: contains the entry point of our program
4. typechecker: contains our modified typechecker
    - This contains a parser, TAST, TPAL, Type, and utils sub-directory
