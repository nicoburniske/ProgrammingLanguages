92/100 + Bonus: 7/10

Task 1 (alpha-equals)
----------------------------------------

-2 no alha-equals unit tests for a combination of 
   decls and functions with arguments, e.g. decl inside function or vice versa
   (to check that scopes of decls and function arguments are handled correctly,
   one does need a non-zero arguments function) 

Task 2 (CPS)
----------------------------------------

-1 it's not documented that the nameGenerator is needed
   (which generates 10 letters long variable names),
   to avoid collisions between k and variables in a program
   (this is crucial for the correctness of your CPS transformation)

-5 (alpha-equal) unit tests for cps do not have examples where the generation
   of variable names would be necessary for the CPS correctness
   (variable named "k" in the source program would be such an example) +
   no unit tests for complex decls and function calls (they are commented
   out, which suggests that there is a bug somewhere?)

+7 unit tests for cps that use interpret (you would have got full bonus points
   if interpreted source programs instead of hard coding values --
   it's hard to see if the unit tests are actually correct)

-0 using the same "k" for all continuations might be fine in this homework,
   but you better generate different variable names in the next one

 Misc Comments
----------------------------------------

Nice comments and organization of the code. (Except too many nested folders are annoying to grade :))
