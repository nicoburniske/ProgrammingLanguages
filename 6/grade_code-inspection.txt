-5 purpose statement for type checker does not mention type errors
   (type checker does not always return a StarAST)
+0 no accumulator statement for environment

-10 no purpose statement for *AST/TAST-to-JSON renderer
    (if there is one and I didn't find it, don't hesitate to let me know)

 Misc Comments
----------------------------------------

Nice file structure and test coverage.

Please, figure out how to write unit tests with assert-throws 
instead of try-catch! Testing frameworks do have support for checking exceptions.

Unit tests are hard to read. Consider moving examples outside testing functions
and using aux variables such as

  varAInt = new TypedVar("a", new TypeInt())
  
(note that this pattern appears multiple times in the tests).
And maybe add human readable comments explaining the examples, e.g.

  let b:int = 
  
for

  [\"let\",[\"b\",\":\",\"int\"],\"=\"
